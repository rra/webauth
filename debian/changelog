  * Set Secure cookie flag properly with WebAuthSSLReturn.
  * Correctly honor WebKdcTokenMaxTTL for request tokens.
  * Suppress CGI warnings from using param in list context in WebLogin.
  * Add missing word in default WebLogin help text.  (Closes: #783289)
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V11.
    - Remove now-unnecessary explicit dependency on dh-autoreconf.
  * Switch to the DEP-14 branch layout and update debian/gbp.conf and
    Vcs-Git accordingly.

webauth (4.7.0-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update build dependency to libssl-dev (OpenSSL 1.1).  (Closes: #859788)
  * Remove old transitional packages for the Apache module renaming.
  * Update standards version to 4.0.1.
    - Change all extra priorities to optional.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 07 Aug 2017 07:54:47 -0700

webauth (4.7.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add a patch to change the function used to probe for the OpenSSL
    library, allowing WebAuth to build against OpenSSL 1.1.
  * Depend on libssl1.0-dev anyway, since Apache currently requires
    libssl1.0-dev and otherwise build dependencies are not installable.
    (Closes: #828597)
  * Mark libwebauth-perl Multi-Arch: same, trusting the multiarch hinter
    to be correct about this.
  * Change Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser to https URLs.
  * Fix duplicate words in the documentation caught by Lintian.
  * Run wrap-and-sort -ast.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.8 (no changes required).

webauth (4.7.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Explicitly Build-Depend on libmodule-build-perl, since it will be
    removed from Perl core in the next release.  (Closes: #796156)
  * Mention WebKDC in the description of libwebkc-perl in case someone is
    searching for packages containing that module.
  * Add overrides for apache2-module-depends-on-real-apache2-package,
    which appears to be a bug in either lintian or dh_apache2.

webauth (4.7.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Moved libtime-duration-perl to Depends from Suggests.  This is now
    used unconditionally upstream.  (Closes: #783288)
  * Add debian/gbp.conf reflecting the branch layout of the default
    packaging repository.
  * Fix upstream distribution signing key.

webauth (4.7.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Upload to experimental due to release freeze.
  * Rename libwebauth11 to libwebauth12 for upstream SONAME change.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.6.

  [ Jon C. Robertson ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Recognize KRB5_BAD_ENCTYPE, KRB5_GET_IN_TKT_LOOP,
      KRB5_PREAUTH_FAILED, and KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED as additional
      synonyms for a failed login error code.  Various combinations of
      recent MIT and Heimdal with different KDCs return these error
      codes if the password is incorrect.
    - Added new fields to the userinfo service parsing and the WebLogin
      handling.  These allow for a more complicated multifactor
      configuration to be passed along from the user information
      service, with multiple possible multifactor devices and one
      default.
    - Give a validation remctl command its own timeout error, so that a
      failure to respond to validation is handled differently than any
      other timeout failure.  This is done so that we can handle
      out-of-band multifactor methods, such as a phone call.  Previously
      that would show up in WebLogin as a generic
      WK_ERR_UNRECOVERABLE_ERROR.
    - Ability to use JSON rather than XML for the user information
      service's return values.  This is activated with the
      WebKdcUserInfoJSON configuration directive.
    - Refactored the userinfo code to separate remctl support, XML
      parsing, and JSON parsing into separate source files for
      readability.
  * Added build-depends for libjansson-dev (>= 2.6), pkg-config,
    libfreezethaw-perl, libauthen-oath-perl,
    libcrypt-generatepassword-perl, libgetopt-long-descriptive-perl,
    libjson-perl, libmime-base32-perl, libnet-remctl-perl, and
    libwww-mechanize-perl.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 05 Apr 2015 17:17:38 -0700

webauth (4.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix legacy support for AuthType StanfordAuth.
    - New mod_webkdc configuration directive, WebKdcFastArmorCache, that
      tells the WebKDC to always use FAST armor when obtaining initial
      credentials using a password.
    - Fix parsing of the WebKdcKerberosFactors directive.
    - New webauth_krb5_set_fast_armor_path API.
    - Show expiring password warning in WebLogin after any POST.
    - Translate KRB5_KDC_UNREACH into a user rejected error instead of an
      internal failure.
    - Translate an EINVAL error to an incorrect password error code.
    - Verify the username field on multifactor authentication to avoid
      warnings from later in the code.
    - Allow newlines, CRs, and tabs in XML from the WebKDC to the WebLogin
      server, fixing display of some user message elements.
    - Force display of the confirmation page if authorization identity
      switching is permitted.
    - Diagnose empty RT and ST parameters to WebLogin.
    - Add new factors mp (mobile push) and v (voice).
    - Warn in the mod_webauth documentation that all members of a
      load-balanced pool accepting credential delegation must use the same
      Kerberos identity.
  * Enable tests controlled with AUTOMATED_TESTING.
  * Rename packages and change library symbols for upstream SONAME bump
    and symbol versioning changes.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Jul 2014 14:28:06 -0700

webauth (4.6.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use an executable debian/libwebauth-perl.install file and some Perl
    code in debian/rules to pull the correct Perl arch-specific vendor
    module path from Perl during the build.  Should fix builds with Perl
    5.20.  Thanks, Niko Tyni and gregor herrmann.  (Closes: #752903)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Jul 2014 21:54:21 -0700

webauth (4.6.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Handle ownership change of the mod_webauth keyring in the
    libapache2-webauth transition package as well, since that's the
    package that will see the versioned upgrade.
  * Tighten dependency of libwebkdc-perl on libwebauth-perl to ensure that
    the remctl password change API is available.
  * Refresh debian/copyright with current upstream LICENSE file.
  * Remove now-unneeded Lintian override for the upstream signing key.
  * Add a Lintian override for the dual-licensed protocol specification.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Apr 2014 13:46:27 -0700

webauth (4.6.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Change ownership of the mod_webauth keyring to www-data on upgrade
    from prior versions if it was owned by root.  Versions prior to 4.6.0
    created the keyring during Apache configuration parsing before Apache
    dropped privileges, but keyring handling is now done by the Apache
    child processes.  Without this change, WebAuth actions would fail
    because the keyring could not be initialized.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Mar 2014 13:50:40 -0700

webauth (4.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - New mod_webauth configuration directive, WebAuthCookiePath, which
      scopes all cookies set by mod_webauth within the directive scope to
      the given path.  Be sure that any WebAuthDoLogout URL is scoped with
      the same path.  When using this directive, ensure all protected
      portions of the site are covered by a directive and none of the
      scopes are overlapping.
    - WebAuthOptional should now work properly with Apache 2.4.
    - Do not delete mod_webauth notes after using them, which prevents
      some double-redirects to WebLogin during subrequests.
    - mod_webauth and mod_webkdc now maintain separate in-memory keyrings
      for each virtual host, and WebAuthKeyring, WebKdcKeyring, and
      related directives are now properly honored in virtual host
      configuration.  This fixes keyring leaks between virtual hosts when
      using the ITK MPM.
    - Be more thorough in telling browsers to not cache WebLogin
      responses, redirects and logout pages, and WebAuthDontCache pages.
    - All keyring writes are now locked with a separate lock file (the
      keyring file name with ".lock" appended) in the same directory.
    - Keyring updates now preserve ownership and permissions where
      possible.
    - Use the authenticated identity returned by the WebKDC for
      multifactor authentication in WebLogin rather than preserving the
      user's original entry.  The WebKDC may have canonicalized.
    - Support a remctl-based password change protocol in WebLogin and in
      libwebauth via the new webauth_krb5_change_config API.
    - Set the correct template variable when the code field is left blank
      on the WebLogin multifactor form.
    - Map unknown realm and invalid principal errors during Kerberos
      authentication to WA_PEC_USER_REJECTED instead of a generic Kerberos
      error so that WebLogin will present a more helpful error message.
    - Fix a bug in the workaround for invalid XML from the WebKDC.
    - Log a more detailed message during WebLogin password change
      failures.
  * Add the upstream signing key to debian/upstream/signing-key.asc and
    configure uscan to do signature validation.  Configure uscan to
    download the xz tarball instead of the gz tarball.
  * Remove now-unnecessary override of dh_builddeb to use xz compression.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.5 (no changes required).

webauth (4.5.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 08 Sep 2013 10:51:03 -0700

webauth (4.5.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Warn about mismatched webkdc-proxy tokens but no longer treat them
      as a fatal error.
    - Fix handling of non-password session factor requirements.
    - Improve handling of initial factor requirements when users have a
      way to establish initial credentials that don't include a password
      factor.
    - Improve handling of a Kerberos webkdc-proxy token requirement during
      a multifactor authentication.
    - Retry WebLogin posts to the WebKDC once to be more robust against
      interruptions by signals (such as from the FastCGI process manager).
    - Produce more succinct and hopefully better error messages when
      WebLogin cannot post to the WebKDC.
    - Ignore SIGPIPE signals in WebLogin scripts.
    - Require the return URL be absolute and not contain non-ASCII
      characters in mod_webkdc processing.
    - Fix WebLogin replay detection logic to not trigger on password
      changes.
    - Work around problems in WebLogin caused by the WebKDC returning
      error messages that contain undeclared non-UTF-8 characters in
      violation of the XML standard.
    - Improve error reporting of unparsable XML received by the WebLogin
      server from the WebKDC.
    - Fix logging of mod_webkdc <requestTokenRequest> failures.
    - Fix the prototype attributes for webauth_user_validate.
    - Log when mod_webkdc ignores expired tokens.
    - Display more correct errors after some failures during the second
      step of a multifactor authentication.
    - Correctly diagnose a missing service token in a WebLogin request and
      report the correct error instead of an internal error.
    - Make the version of all Perl modules match the WebAuth release.
    - Better error display for logins rejected by the user information
      service.
    - Better error display for multifactor authentication errors.
    - Rate limiting and replay detection are now also applied to the
      multifactor login page.
    - Fix replay detection by correcting choice of memcached keys.
    - Support staying on the code entry page after an error when using an
      SMS method for multifactor.  Local template changes are required to
      take advantage of this feature.

webauth (4.5.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only remove /var/lib/webauth during purge if the directory exists.
    Both libapache2-mod-webauth and libapache2-mod-webauthldap create and
    use that directory, so it may have already been removed by the other
    package.  (Closes: #714602)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 01 Jul 2013 15:21:48 -0700

webauth (4.5.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch to fix incorrect linkage of some of the test
    programs.  (Closes: #713452)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Jun 2013 12:14:52 -0700

webauth (4.5.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move mod_webauthldap into a separate libapache2-mod-webauthldap
    package.  This permits better dependencies, more closely conforms to
    the Apache module naming convention, and allows users who aren't
    interested in the LDAP module to easily remove it.  Note that the
    libapache2-mod-webauth package does not attempt to clean up
    configuration files left behind from the mod_webauthldap module, since
    nearly all users upgrading from an older version will end up with both
    packages installed, and removal of libapache2-mod-webauthldap will do
    the right thing.  Additional cleanup would only be needed for people
    upgrading from experimental versions of libapache2-mod-webauth who do
    not install libapache2-mod-webauthldap and doesn't seem worth the
    complexity.
  * Add proper Breaks/Replaces for the Apache module package renaming.
  * Pass LDFLAGS from the main build to the Perl module build so that the
    hardening flags are set properly.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 02 Jun 2013 12:12:40 -0700

webauth (4.5.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Now that dh_apache2 has an option to not enable the modules by
    default, let it handle all module setup for libapache2-mod-webauth
    except for the Apache restart and remove the now-unnecessary prerm
    script.
  * Simplify libcgi-application-perl Depends and Build-Depends by dropping
    the alternatives that were required for squeeze.
  * Add build dependency on dh-apache2 per the dh_apache2 manual page.

webauth (4.5.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - SECURITY: Clear header state between requests to avoid information
      leaks or infinite redirects for WebLogin servers using FastCGI and
      $REMUSER_REDIRECT (not the default).  The vulnerability was
      introduced in WebAuth 4.4.1.  All versions of WebAuth with this
      vulnerability were only uploaded to Debian experimental.
      (CVE-2013-2106)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 15 May 2013 13:57:37 -0700

webauth (4.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - WebLogin now supports preserving remember_login on authentication
      failure.  Template changes are required.
    - Fix clearing of failed authentication attempts on successful auth.
    - Fix setting cookies on the WebLogin error page.
    - Stop clearing single sign-on cookies on cookie test redirect.
  * Recommend the GSS-API SASL module packages for mod_webauthldap and
    document their need in README.Debian.
  * Update the Debian-specific installation instructions to reference
    conf-available and a2enconf instead of /etc/apache2/conf.d.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 14 May 2013 19:15:35 -0700

webauth (4.5.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix support for single sign-on in WebLogin, broken in 4.5.0.
    - Document additional template changes required for remember_login.
    - Preserve remember_login through a forced password change.
    - Pass any user information service message to the confirm template.
    - Avoid re-creating WebAuth cookies unnecessarily in WebLogin.
    - Fix a few bugs in the installable mod_webauth test suite.
  * Increase Breaks and minimum dependency versions between the WebLogin
    components to 4.5.0.
  * Remove a stray Debian revision in the libwebauth10 symbols file.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 01 May 2013 15:31:24 -0700

webauth (4.5.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - WebLogin now supports indicating, on the login form template,
      whether to create single sign-on cookies.  The default form sends a
      parameter saying to do so, but the default behavior is to not create
      the cookies.  This will require a template change for most WebLogin
      deployments.
    - Revert change in WebAuthForceLogin interpretation introduced in
      WebAuth 4.4.0.  It once again requires authentication with a login
      token.  Document that it will not work well with authorization
      identities set after authentication.
    - Fix password change handling in WebLogin, broken since 4.4.0.
    - Fix reporting of password rejection reasons, broken since 4.3.0.
    - mod_webauth and mod_webkdc now produce much better error logs.
    - Initial multifactor no longer satisfies a requirement for random
      session multifactor, correcting a long-standing bug.
    - New WebAuthLdapOperationalAttribute directive for mod_webauthldap
      that allows inclusion of operational attributes in the environment.
    - WebLogin no longer supports obtaining the password expiration from a
      kadmin-remctl backend via a direct remctl call.  Instead, it uses
      the value from the WebKDC, which comes from the user information
      service.
    - The WebLogin confirmation page supports a new expire_timestamp
      variable, which contains the password expiration in seconds since
      UNIX epoch.  This should be used instead of the (deprecated)
      expire_date variable since it isn't preformatted and can therefore
      be localized.  See the sample confirm.tmpl template for how to
      format the date for display.
    - New support for persistent cookies containing additional factors,
      controlled by the user information service.
    - The WebKDC now passes the user's current factors to the user
      information service as an additional parameter to the userinfo
      call, which can be used to change behavior based on whether the user
      has persistent factors set.
    - The user information service can now return a specific set of
      required factors instead of just indicating multifactor is required.
    - The user information service can return a message for display in
      the multifactor authentication page in WebLogin (and that has been
      added to the default templates).
    - The user information service can, in both the userinfo and validate
      calls, return an opaque data structure to WebLogin, and WebLogin can
      send an opaque data structre back in the validate call.  This allows
      for multistep multifactor interactions outside of WebAuth's
      knowledge, such as resynchronization of hardware tokens.
    - The user information service can add factors to a user's successful
      interactive authentication.
    - WebLogin and the multifactor page template now receive a list of the
      factors a user needs but doesn't yet have, instead of just a
      complete list of the desired factors.
    - WebLogin can now tell the WebKDC and, in turn, the user information
      service what type of OTP authentication was used, if it knows.
    - The user information service can indicate the expiration time of
      factors resulting from an OTP authentication.
    - Errors in contacting the user information service are now logged
      even if the WebKDC is configured to ignore those errors.
    - Multiple changes to the libwebauth API, most notably revisions to
      the webkdc_login and userinfo APIs and a new opaque factors data
      type.
    - mod_webkdc no longer supports obtaining proxy tokens via a
      <getTokenRequest> call.  This was never used and is conceptually
      useless.
    - undef arguments to Perl XS functions are now properly diagnosed.
  * Fix some incorrect URLs in the webauth-tests package that were left
    over from the test suite rewrite.
  * Use an uppercase realm name in the token.acl example in README.Debian
    for libapache2-mod-webkdc.  Nearly all Kerberos realms will be
    uppercase and the realm is case-sensitive.  Thanks to Lisandro Damián
    Nicanor Pérez Meyer for the report.  (Closes: #705557)

webauth (4.4.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix WebAuthTrustAuthzIdentity to not enable WebAuthDoLogout.
    - Correctly handle an authorization identity equal to the
      authentication identity rather than rejecting it with an error.
    - Remove an arbitrary mod_webauthldap limit in the number of values
      of a multivalued attribute will be exposed in the environment.
    - Fix a syntax error in replay handling in the default WebLogin
      template.
    - Ignore empty app cookies in mod_webauth instead of logging an
      error.  These are created internally by mod_webauth when the app
      cookie has expired.
    - Better mod_webauth logging when the user's app cookie has expired.
    - Stop logging the binary app token in mod_webauth.
    - Fix some obscure error handling cases caught by clang --analyze.
  * Use the new -q flag to a2query when probing for whether mod_webauth
    or mod_webauthldap are enabled, and depend on the appropriate version
    of apache2.
  * Let dh_apache2 handle configuration of libapache2-mod-webkdc now that
    we can tell it to skip libapache2-mod-webauth, and build-depend on the
    appropriate version of apache2-dev.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Mar 2013 19:13:45 -0700

webauth (4.4.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix an occasional WebKDC crash when determining if an authentication
      is interactive.  Should fix FTBFS on powerpc.
    - Add additional Autoconf checks to hopefully build on Hurd.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 05 Feb 2013 13:50:16 -0800

webauth (4.4.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New authenticate callback supported in WebLogin configuration.
    - WebLogin should now run more efficiently under FastCGI.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 31 Jan 2013 19:18:00 -0800

webauth (4.4.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New authorization identity support in all components of WebAuth.
    - New WebKdcLoginTimeLimit directive for mod_webkdc to control the
      time limit for multistage login and when a recent login no longer
      counts towards session factors.
    - WebAuthForceLogin no longer forces re-authentication if the last
      authentication was within WebKdcLoginTimeLimit.
    - WebLogin now optionally supports replay detection and rate limiting
      of failed login attempts.  This support requires a memcached server
      to store the relevant data.
    - The WebLogin error template now takes two new parameters for errors
      related to replays and rate limiting.
    - Set single sign-on cookies in WebLogin if appropriate even when
      displaying an error.  This fixes looping issues with site
      restrictions done via the user innformation service.
    - The WebLogin configuration options @REMUSER_LOCAL_REALMS and
      @REMUSER_PERMITTED_REALMS replace @REMUSER_REALMS.  The latter is
      supported for backward compatibility.
    - Multiple fixes for encoding of Kerberos credentials.
    - Fix mapping of WebKDC error codes to names in WebLogin.
    - Document the WebAuthRequireSSL directive.
    - webauth_token_{encrypt,decrypt} are now part of the public API.
    - webauth_base64_*, webauth_hex_*, webauth_attr_*, and webauth_attrs_*
      functions are no longer part of the public API.
    - The webauth.h header has been removed.  Use the more specific
      webauth/*.h headers.
    - New public webauth_keyring_encode and webauth_keyring_decode
      functions and corresponding Perl API to handle keyring serialization
      without requiring that it be done to a file.
    - The WA_TK_*, WA_TT_*, and WA_SA_* preprocessor constants are no
      longer provided.  They weren't useful.
    - The WA_ERR_KEYRING_* error codes have changed to WA_ERR_FILE_* and
      new error code WA_ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND has been added.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.4.
    - Update Vcs-Git to specify the Debian packaging branch.

    - Fix memory initialization error in the WebKDC that could cause
      incorrect handling of random multifactor verification.
    - Fix memory allocation error in the WebAuth Perl module that could
      cause memory corruption in the WebLogin server.
  * Add Breaks of libwebkdc-perl and webauth-weblogin << 4.3.0 to
    libwebauth-perl and of webauth-weblogin << 4.3.0 to libwebkdc-perl.
    The API of the Perl modules changed in 4.3.0.  (Closes: #691878)
  * Remove ~ on 4.3.0 dependencies.  There were no pre-release versions,
    so this is just visual clutter.
  * Drop Replaces and Breaks on libwebauth1-dev, not required since the
    squeeze release.

webauth (4.3.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix memory pool allocation error in mod_webauth that could prevent
      it from obtaining a service token from the WebKDC.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Sep 2012 19:43:24 -0700

webauth (4.3.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - WebAuthDoLogout is now allowed in .htaccess via AuthConfig.
    - Fix an invalid free in webauth_webkdc_login.
    - Fix incorrect Perl module includes in pwchange.fcgi.
    - Add an overloaded cmp operator for WebAuth::Exception.
  * Tighten the dependencies between the Perl modules and WebLogin.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 08 Aug 2012 20:38:58 -0700

webauth (4.3.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - mod_webauth now sets HttpOnly on cookies by default.  There is a new
      WebAuthHttpOnly flag to disable this behavior.
    - WebLogin now sets HttpOnly on all cookies.
    - Add new optional <userMessage> element to <requestTokenResponse>
      from the WebKDC and a new error code to indicate that this HTML
      error should be displayed to the user.
    - Support an <error> return element from the user information
      service and pass it as the <userMessage> element.
    - Add WebLogin support via an err_html parameter to display the error
      returned in the <userMessage> element from the WebKDC.
    - Change all Kerberos functions in the WebAuth library API to take the
      WebAuth context and use APR.  Remove some unused functions, merge
      others, and rename others.  Update the Perl API to match.  Any Perl
      programs that call WebAuth Kerberos functions will require updates.
    - Fix decoding of Kerberos credentials with a second ticket.
    - Kerberos realms are no longer escaped before matching them against
      the Apache configuration.  This only affects handling of realm names
      with unusual characters.
  * Mark webauth-tests and webauth-weblogin as Multi-Arch: foreign.  This
    is necessary even for arch: all packages.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 06 Aug 2012 20:35:13 -0700

webauth (4.2.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix WebKDC::WebRequest error in proxy cookie handling that broke
      WebLogin functionality.
    - Fix Kerberos context cleanup after saving delegated credentials.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Jul 2012 16:19:25 -0700

webauth (4.2.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix keyring decoding from files on 64-bit systems.
    - Fix uninitialized memory error in token-encode test case.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Jul 2012 16:41:50 -0700

webauth (4.2.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Add support for Apache 2.4.  (Closes: #666861)
    - Support for AuthType StanfordAuth has been deprecated, and the
      corresponding mod_webauthldap support is not available when built
      against Apache 2.4.
    - Support use of Kerberos keyring caches for passing delegated
      credentials from mod_webauth to CGI and embedded code.
    - Fix merging of mod_webkdc Apache directives in corner cases.
    - Hopefully fix some problems with orphaned WebLogin login.fcgi and
      pwchange.fcgi scripts when running under FastCGI.
    - Significant revisions of the WebAuth Perl module API.
    - Allow id tokens of type krb5 to omit the subject attribute.
    - Convert the key and keyring functions in the WebAuth library API
      to use APR.  The signatures of these functions have therefore
      changed, and keyring manipulation has changed considerably.  Some
      of the APIs have been simplified or renamed.
    - The webauth_random_bytes, webauth_random_key, webauth_token_create,
      and webauth_token_parse APIs have been removed
    - All Perl modules now have POD documentation.
  * Convert to Apache 2.4 and follow the Apache module policy.
    - Rename libapache2-webauth to libapache2-mod-webauth and
      libapache2-webkdc to libapache2-mod-webkdc.  Add transitional
      packages to ease the upgrade.
    - Use dh_apache2 to handle module and configuration installation.  Do
      not use it for maintainer script actions, since
      libapache2-mod-webauth modules have required configuration and can't
      be enabled by default.
    - Update the maintainer script actions for the new Apache module
      policy.
    - Depend on apache2-dev instead of apache2-threaded-dev.
    - Remove explicit dependencies on apache2.2-common.
    - Use apxs, not apxs2.
  * Mark libwebauth7 and libwebauth-dev Multi-Arch: same and webauth-utils
    Multi-Arch: foreign.  Convert to multiarch library paths.
  * libwebauth-dev now suggests libapr1-dev since it is required to use
    the parts of the API that require APR (such as keyring traversal or
    creating the WebAuth context from an existing APR pool).
  * Switch to xz compression for the upstream and Debian tarballs and for
    the data element of the generated binary packages.
  * Enable parallel builds.
  * Use dh-autoreconf to always regenerate the build system from source.
    Link with --as-needed to ensure we don't pick up unnecessary shared
    library dependencies.
  * Move single-debian-patch to local-options and patch-header to
    local-patch-header so that they only apply to the packages I build and
    NMUs get regular version-numbered patches.
  * Purging libapache2-mod-{webauth,webkdc} no longer unconditionally
    removes the contents of /var/lib/{webauth,webkdc}.  Instead, known
    files are removed and then removal of the directory is attempted,
    ignoring failure if the directory is non-empty.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V9.
    - Use dpkg-buildflags to set CFLAGS.
    - Enable bindnow hardening.  Leave PIE off for right now.
    - Simplify all *.install rules to remove debian/tmp and not specify
      the destination if it echoes the source.
  * Convert debian/copyright to copyright-format 1.0.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Jul 2012 22:58:20 -0700

webauth (4.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (no Apache 2.4 support yet; that's next).
    - Fix webauth_user_info bug in interpreting login history timestamps.
    - Fix login history timestamp handling in sample confirm template.
    - Suppress history and token rights in sample confirm template when
      those data elements are empty.  (Closes: #664735)
    - Add explicit HTML filters to all sample template variable
      interpolations as an additional security measure.
    - Update the mod_webkdc manual for changes in 4.1.0.
  * If Apache is running and has the module loaded, restart Apache on
    configure of libapache2-webauth or libapache2-webkdc.
  * Remove the conditional around the postinst actions for
    libapache2-webauth and libapache2-webkdc and just always configure the
    package.  This is at least arguably more correct for the various abort
    cases, is simpler, and shouldn't hurt.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Apr 2012 14:41:39 -0700

webauth (4.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New mod_webkdc WebKdcUserInfoTimeout option to set a network timeout
      for user information service queries.  The new default is 30
      seconds.
    - New mod_webkdc WebKdcUserInfoIgnoreFail error to allow users to
      authenticate with password and use pre-existing single sign-on
      cookies even if the user information service is down.  Be aware that
      this can allow bypassing a centrally-mandated multifactor
      requirement.
    - Use remctl_set_ccache instead of setting KRB5CCNAME when available
      to avoid memory leaks on calling the user information service and to
      not leak settings across threads.
    - Fix WebLogin error handling when the password field is left blank.
    - Fix WebLogin error handling of empty usernames.
    - Drop library support for base64-encoded token attributes (which was
      never used by WebAuth).
    - Drop webauth_info_{build,version} library APIs.
    - Document Apache/Tomcat security interaction around URL parsing in
      the mod_webauth manual.  This affects any Apache security mechanism
      used in conjunction with Tomcat.
  * Bump libremctl-dev build dependency to >= 3.1 for consistent builds.
  * Add Build-Depends-Package to the symbols file for better dependency
    handling.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.3 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Mar 2012 16:18:41 -0700

webauth (4.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix setting of the REMOTE_USER preference cookie in WebLogin.
    - Ignore undefined cookies in WebLogin to reduce error logs.
    - Document factor codes in the mod_webauth manual.
  * Remove ${shlibs:Depends} from libwebauth-dev dependencies to remove a
    warning.  This package won't contain compiled binaries.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 02 Dec 2011 21:01:09 -0800

webauth (4.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Change user information service and WebKDC to WebLogin protocols for
      conveying suspicious login information to use the IP address as the
      CDATA and put the hostname in an attribute.
    - Display suspicious logins in WebLogin, forcing a confirmation page.
    - Log the return URL of authentication requests to the WebKDC.
    - Reduce mod_webauth log level when retrieving credentials.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Sep 2011 13:42:17 -0700

webauth (4.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a variety of uninitialized variables and memory leaks in the
    libwebauth library and the test suite.  Thanks, Christoph Egger and
    Aaron M. Ucko.  (Closes: #640259)
  * Don't attempt to chown files in libwebkdc-perl when doing a
    binary-only build.  Thanks, Aaron M. Ucko.  (Closes: #640268)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 03 Sep 2011 13:07:04 -0700

webauth (4.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Added support for multifactor, including new WebAuth directives
      WebAuthRequireInitialFactor, WebAuthRequireSessionFactor, and
      WebAuthRequireLOA and new WebKDC directives WebKdcUserInfoURL and
      WebKdcUserInfoPrincipal.  Currently requires a metadata service for
      which there isn't a packaged implementation.
    - mod_webauth now exposes the user's initial and session
      authentication details and level of assurance (if known) in
      environment variables WEBAUTH_FACTORS_INITIAL,
      WEBAUTH_FACTORS_SESSION, and WEBAUTH_LOA.
    - WebLogin now uses Template Toolkit for all templating.  All
      templates will have to be revised to use the new syntax.
    - WebLogin can tell an external middleware service to send the user an
      OTP code via some means, such as SMS.  There are new configuration
      variables for /etc/webkdc/webkdc.conf that control this.
    - WebLogin now supports a site-specific callback to determine the
      initial and session factors and level of assurance for a user who
      has been authenticated via Apache authentication.
    - The keyring functions of the WebAuth Perl module have been rewritten
      to use an object-oriented style and new WebAuth::Keyring and
      WebAuth::KeyringEntry objects.  Perl code that used the keyring API
      will need to be modified.  Methods to remove a key from a keyring,
      get the timestamps and keys associated with keyring entries, and
      choose the best key have been added.
    - The libwebauth API has been changed substantially and will be
      changed further in subsequent releases.
    - The proxy data attribute of webkdc-proxy tokens is now optional.
  * Install /var/cache/weblogin, writable by www-data, as a directory to
    use for Template Toolkit to cache compiled templates.  Mention the new
    $TEMPLATE_COMPILE_PATH directive in the libwebkdc-perl NEWS.Debian.
  * Update the webauth-weblogin README.Debian to mention the Apache
    FastCGI module now included in Debian and the alternative in
    non-free.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 02 Sep 2011 15:57:56 -0700

webauth (3.7.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New Apache directive WebAuthOptional, which does not force the user
      to authenticate if they're not already authenticated but adds the
      authentication information to the environment if they are.  Intended
      for use with dynamic content that can manage optional authentication
      through an explicit login link.
    - Work around an MIT Kerberos library bug in error reporting from
      password change and remove the previous cruder workaround that
      mapped Kerberos errors to password strength warnings.
    - Suppress certificate validation for the WebKDC in WebLogin if the
      WebKDC URL is localhost, required by libwww-perl 5.837 or later.
    - More robust generation of the pkg-config configuration file.
    - Clearer warning from WebLogin when paired with an old WebKDC.
    - Document the pt and sa key/value pairs in WebKDC logging.
  * Drop the transitional libwebauth1-dev package, required to smooth
    upgrades from lenny.  squeeze released with libwebauth-dev.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V8.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization with overrides.
    - Do more work in *.install files and less work in debian/rules.
  * Switch to 3.0 (quilt) source format.  Force a single Debian patch and
    include a custom patch header explaining that it is a rollup of any
    fixes cherry-picked from upstream and breaking those patches out
    separately would be work for no gain.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.2 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 11 May 2011 15:26:32 -0700

webauth (3.7.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

webauth (3.7.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix wa_keyring option parsing problems introduced in 3.7.0.
    - Fix uninitalized variable causing wa_keyring to randomly default to
      verbose mode.
    - mod_webkdc now returns user rejected instead of a generic Kerberos
      error for attempted authentications to expired or disabled
      accounts, improving the error message displayed by WebLogin.
  * Add build dependencies on libipc-run-perl and libtimedate-perl to
    enable wa_keyring tests.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.1 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Aug 2010 15:31:18 -0700

webauth (3.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Password change in WebLogin now forces re-entry of the old password
      on the same screen as the new password even if the user had just
      authenticated, with a configuration option to disable this.
    - The default proxy token lifetime is now the lifetime of the
      underlying Kerberos credential, matching the documentation, instead
      of ten hours.
    - Improve error reporting in WebLogin for password change failures.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Jul 2010 12:51:43 -0700

webauth (3.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - WebAuthLdapAuthRule in mod_webauthldap now sets environment
      variables to the value "privgroup <privgroup>" rather than the
      previous behavior of just "<privgroup>".
    - New WebAuthLdapPrivgroup directive for mod_webauthldap which probes
      user's membership in multiple privgroups and sets an environment
      variable to the list of those they're in.
    - WebAuthLdapAttribute can now take multiple attributes on one line.
    - WebLogin includes a password change script and template.
    - WebLogin now supports password expiration handling.
    - WebLogin may be configured to warn users of expiring passwords.
    - WebLogin catches SIGTERM in login.fcgi and finishes the current
      request, fixing some problems with unclean shutdown when FastCGI
      restarts the running scripts.
    - WebLogin correctly encodes RT and ST in the URL when redirecting to
      an alternate URL when attempting REMOTE_USER authentication.
    - wa_keyring now uses ISO format for timestamps.
    - Various changes and cleanup to the WebAuth library API.
    - Link wa_keyring with libcrypto properly.  (Closes: #556674)
    - Avoid importing isa from UNIVERSAL.  (Closes: #578632)
    - Lower the log level of some mod_webauth diagnostics.
  * The default help.html file is now installed into
    /usr/share/weblogin/generic/templates instead of one level higher.
  * Upstream now no longer uses apxs to install modules, so upstream
    supports DESTDIR and debian/rules can use make install instead of
    rewriting all the installation rules.
  * Drop the SONAME version from libwebauth-dev.  We'll never need to
    maintain development packages for more than one version of the ABI in
    Debian at the same time.  Add a transitional package to assist with
    upgrades.
  * Move Perl module dependencies from webauth-weblogin to libwebkdc-perl
    since the supporting modules now load the other required Perl modules.
  * Bump the versioned dependencies from webauth-weblogin and
    libwebkc-perl on libwebauth-perl and in webauth-weblogin on
    libwebkdc-perl.
  * Add an explicit dependency on liburi-perl to libwebkdc-perl.
  * Fix Perl dependencies in webauth-weblogin and webauth-tests.
  * Add a Suggests of libapache2-mod-php5 to webauth-tests.
  * Add Suggests of libtimedate-perl, libtime-duration-perl, and
    libnet-remctl-perl to libwebkdc-perl, required for now for expiring
    password warning support.
  * Downgrade the libwebauth-dev dependency on libkrb5-dev to Suggests
    since it's only required for static linking.
  * Update build dependency to libcurl4-openssl-dev.
  * Add additional build dependencies so that the Perl module test suite
    can run.
  * Force source format 1.0 for right now to make backporting easier.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V7.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} to all dependencies.
    - Use dh_prep instead of dh_clean -k.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.0 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Aug 2009 16:24:26 -0700

webauth (3.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - $BYPASS_CONFIRM now suppresses the confirm page after POST for
      browsers that support this.
    - $BYPASS_CONFIRM can be set to "id" to only bypass the confirmation
      page if the WAS is not requesting a proxy token (and hence may
      request delegated credentials).
    - New variables for the WebLogin confirmation page containing
      delegated credential details.
    - Better WebLogin cookie handling with confirmation bypass.
  * Remove -L and -l flags to dh_shlibdeps, which are no longer needed.
  * Remove full paths to a2dismod in the package prerm scripts.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.2.
    - Change sections of Apache modules.

    - Add WebLogin support for delegated credentials.  Based on work by
      Joachim Keltsch.  (Closes: #466792)
    - New WebKdcLocalRealms and WebKdcPermittedRealms mod_webkdc options.
    - New WebKDC protocol error for a login rejected by policy.
    - New err_rejected variable in the weblogin login.tmpl template.

    - New err_cookies_disabled error template variable.
    - Fix memory allocation for environment variables in mod_webauthldap.
    - Improve display of Shibboleth destination URLs.
  * Incorporate NEWS.Debian into webauth-weblogin.NEWS, since it is the
    only affected package for the old news item.
  * Call dh_fixperms before dh_strip so that the WebAuth Perl module will
    be stripped properly.
  * Recommend httpd-cgi and suggest libapache2-mod-auth-kerb for
